An MCP server that provides access to n8n workflows, executions, credentials, and more through the Model Context Protocol. This allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with n8n instances in a secure and standardized way.

## Validation

After configuration:

1. Restart your LLM application
2. Ask: "List my n8n workflows"
3. You should see your workflows listed

If you get an error:
- Check that your n8n instance is running
- Verify your API key has correct permissions
- Ensure N8N_HOST has no trailing slash

## Features

### Core Features
- List and manage workflows
- View workflow details
- Execute workflows
- Manage credentials
- Handle tags and executions
- Generate security audits
- Manage workflow tags

### Enterprise Features
These features require an n8n Enterprise license:
- Project management
- Variable management
- Advanced user management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. "Client not initialized"
   - Check N8N_HOST and N8N_API_KEY are set correctly
   - Ensure n8n instance is accessible
   - Verify API key permissions

2. "License required"
   - You're trying to use an Enterprise feature
   - Either upgrade to n8n Enterprise or use core features only

3. Connection Issues
   - Verify n8n instance is running
   - Check URL protocol (http/https)
   - Remove trailing slash from N8N_HOST

## Security Best Practices

1. API Key Management
   - Use minimal permissions necessary
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Never commit keys to version control

2. Instance Access
   - Use HTTPS for production
   - Enable n8n authentication
   - Keep n8n updated
